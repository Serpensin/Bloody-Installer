# DBD-SSL-Bypass-and-FOV-Installer
With this script an SSL Bypass and FOV 'hack' can be installed for DBD.
The FOV 'hack' ensures that you have an enlarged FOV  
(field of view).

The program will take about 10-20 seconds to start, so be patient.

Should you get an 'SSL error' while starting DBD, visit us on our Discord (https://discord.gg/gmVkK9p9hA).  
If the error occurs after updating DBD, you have to be patient for ~1-4 hours until I have saved the updated fille in the link.  
To update SSL, all you have to do is run through the program again.

This works for patch 5.0.2
