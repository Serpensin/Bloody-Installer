# DBD-SSL-Bypass-and-FOV-Installer
With this script an SSL Bypass and FOV 'hack' can be installed for DBD.  
The FOV 'hack' ensures that you have an enlarged FOV (field of view).

The program will take a few seconds to start, so please be patient.

Should you get an 'SSL error' while starting DBD, visit us on our Discord (https://discord.gg/gmVkK9p9hA).  
If the error occurs after updating DBD, you have to be patient for ~1-4 hours until I have saved  
the updated file in the link.  
To update SSL, all you have to do is press 'Install SSL'.

This program includes:
- Increased FOV (Not adjustable)
  - Uninstall functionality
- SSL Bypass

This works for patch 5.1.1

Please note that some users currently have problems starting DBD when they have installed the FOV hack.
If you have this problem, you have to verify your files in Steam.
I will delete this message as soon as I find a solution to the problem.
