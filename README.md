# Bloody Installer
With this script an SSL Bypass and FOV 'hack' can be installed for DBD.  
The FOV 'hack' ensures that you have an enlarged FOV (field of view).

The program will take a few seconds to start, so please be patient.

Should you get an 'SSL error' while starting DBD, visit us on our Discord (https://discord.gg/gmVkK9p9hA).  
If the error occurs after updating DBD, you have to be patient for ~1-4 hours until I have saved  
the updated file in the link.  

To update, all you have to do is press the button again.

This program includes:
- Increased FOV (Not adjustable)
- SSL Bypass
- Uninstall functionality for FOV/SSL
  (Even if you didn't install them with this program.)

This works for patch 5.2.2
